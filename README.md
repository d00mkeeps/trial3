13/6/2024 Installation complication
While trying to work on my MacBook Air, I had issues regarding imports. After cloning I ran 'npm install' and then 'npm run dev'. This returned the error message 'Error: The following dependencies are imported but could not be resolved: react-router-dom, @supabase/supabase-js'

**I solved this by manually running 'npm install react-router-dom @supabase/supabase-js'**. If you have issues initializing the app on your own system, I'd recommend starting with that.
